Background

SpaceX, a leader in the space industry, strives to make space travel affordable for everyone. Its accomplishments include sending spacecraft to the international space station, launching a satellite constellation that provides internet access and sending manned missions to space. SpaceX can do this because the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive ($62 million per launch) due to its novel reuse of the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Other providers, which are not able to reuse the first stage, cost upwards of $165 million each. By determining if the first stage will land, we can determine the price of the launch. To do this, we can use public data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX – or a competing company – can reuse the first stage.
